Project Name:
"Pet Adopted"

Short Description of the Website:
In the last 5-6 days, I made a website for my course assignment called "Pet Adopted." This website allows users to adopt a pet and includes a Navbar, Header, Main section, and Footer. The technologies used are HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript (ES6). The website offers adoption options for four different animals: 'DOG', 'CAT', 'RABBIT', and 'BIRD'.

5 Key Features of the Project:
1.When you click the "View More" button in the header section, the page scrolls smoothly to the main section.
2.Clicking the "Details" button on any card opens a modal with information about the selected animal.
3.Clicking a button like "DOG" in the main section shows all cards related to dogs.
4.When you click the "Like" button on a card, the image shifts slightly to the left.
5.If the card lacks information like price, birth date, etc., a "Not Found" message is displayed.
